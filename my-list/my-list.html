        <h2>Lassi </h2>
        <p> Lassi, a creamy, frothy yogurt-based drink, blended with water and various fruits or seasonings (such as
            salt or sugar), that originated in Punjab, India. There are many varieties, but most are either sweet or
            salted; the former is blended with curd or fruit (such as mango) or is whisked with sugar, whereas the
            latter is mixed with salt and/or spices, typically cumin or cardamom. Traditionally, lassi is served in a
            handleless clay cup called a kulhar, and extra malai (clotted cream) may be spooned on top before serving.
            The drink has spread to the rest of the world, especially to Great Britain and countries tied to the former
            British Empire. </p>

        <h2>Chaach</h2>
        <p> Traditional Indian chaas is made by blending cold, rich yogurt with a bit of water and nearly any spices 
            you like. Today Iâ€™m sharing with you two recipes for making chaas. The buttermilk is made by churning or 
            blending yogurt and water with some spices and/or herbs. A bit of butter comes on the surface while 
            churning. If you prefer you can remove the butter fat aside and only serve the buttermilk or serve chaas 
            with the butter fat. We love to have chaas with that bit of butterfat. To make chaas, you can use a 
            blender, an immersion blender, a wired whisk or the traditional Indian handheld wooden churner 
            (called madani).</p>

        <h2>Sattu</h2>
        <p> Sattu Sharbat is one of my favorite childhood summer drinks. This sweet delight that originated in Bihar is
            known for its cooling properties. It is popular across the country and has its own variations in states like
            Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. Once popular as a rural delicacy, Sattu Sharbat eventually caught
            the attention of the urban population. Sattu powder is basically made with roasted black chanas which is
            used to make the drink. It is also used as a condiment in various other dishes like Litti Chokha, Laddoos
            and even Parathas. </p>
